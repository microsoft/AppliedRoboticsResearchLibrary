This library contains repositories containing software applications, data sets, and hardware reference designs to support research and education in the fields of service-robotics. Our team invites you to join us in research and engineering efforts that consider how robots can assist and augment the capabilities of human beings.

Current projects focus on the field of **Human-Robot-Interaction** with the goal of providing service robots the means to effectively communicate with humans. In the future we plan to offer new repositories exploring the fields of robot **Navigation** and object **Manipulation**.

## Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The field of HRI concerns solutions for robot speech, expressions, gestures, and information access to provide natural methods for robot command and control.

### Labanotation Suite
The Labanotation Suite is a collection of repositories comprising a system that can be used to give service robots the ability to move in natural and meaningful ways. It includes software tools, source code, sample data, hardware design kits and simulation software that supports experimentation with the concepts presented in the paper **[Describing Upper-Body Motions Based on Labanotation for Learning-from-Observation Robots](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11263-018-1123-1) (International Journal of Computer Vision, December 2018)**.

#### Gesture Authoring Tools
https://github.com/microsoft/LabanotationSuite

The Gesture Authoring Tools repository provides an upper-torso human-gesture capture and editing solution. The system consists of compiled gesture capture applications using the Microsoft Kinect sensor device and a Windows 10 PC. Editing tools constructed in Python provide gesture trimming and movement analysis options with output in graphical Labanotation scores as well as movement data expressed in Labanotation and implemented in a JSON data format. 

#### gestureBot Design Kit
https://github.com/microsoft/gestureBotDesignKit

With a Windows 10 PC, and optionally a 3D-printer and about $350(USD) in electronic servos and parts, the gestureBot Design Kit repository contains all the information needed to build both a virtual and physical desktop companion robot. It includes browser-based simulation and control software based on the Robotis XL series of servo motors. To construct a physical robot, it provides models for 3D-printable body-parts, a parts-list for electronic components, and step-by-step assembly instructions. No soldering is required, but some manual skill is needed to mate small electronic connectors, as well as manipulate small plastic rivets and miniature metal screws to assemble the body components.
