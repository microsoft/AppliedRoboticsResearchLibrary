# **Robot Fleet**
The following design kits can be used to build robots capable of performing the gestures in the Labanoation Gesture Library.

## **gestureBot**
This is the robot our kit is designed around. The gestureBot is adapted from the Robotis MINI robot kit and uses their newest and low-cost XL-320 servo specifically designed for small-scale humanoid robots. The kit does not require soldering and all of the structural parts can be built with a low-cost desktop 3D printer.

## **MSRAbot**
This design is the orignal robot created by student interns working for Microsoft Research Asia. The MSRAbot supported initial investigations in using Labanotation for capturing human gestural movements and translation to robot motor controls. The kit is based on the Futaba RS303MR servo and is built from a combination of metal structural components and 3D printed parts.

## **Pepper** (coming soon!)
Softbank Robotics' Pepper is a commercial medium-scale semi-humanoid service robot used for a range of information kiosk, entertainment, and customer service applications in public settings.

## **MINI** (coming soon!)
The Robotis MINI is a commercial miniature-scale full humanoid robot kit designed to support education in robot construction and programming.

## **OP2** (coming next year!)
Robotis' OP2 is a commercial small-scale full-humanoid robot designed to support education in robotic programming. This robot provides a platform to consider the challenges of adding lower torso movements to our Gesture Library
